# To-Do-List

 created a To-Do List project using C++ that employs object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. In this project, I've designed two main classes: Task and ToDoList.
The Task class encapsulates the attributes of a task, including its ID, description, due date, and completion status. It provides methods to mark a task as completed and to display its details.
On the other hand, the ToDoList class manages a collection of tasks using an array or vector data structure. It offers functionalities such as adding tasks, displaying all tasks, marking tasks as completed, and removing tasks from the list.
